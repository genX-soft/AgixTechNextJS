🧠 AGIX SITE-WIDE USER HOLD & EXPLORATION SYSTEM

(One system. Multiple entry points. Zero repetition.)

🎯 CORE PRINCIPLE (THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING)

❌ Don’t design tools per page
✅ Design one unified Exploration Engine that adapts based on:

Entry page (URL detection)

User intent signals

Interaction history (session-level)

Industry / service context

Every page becomes a smart gateway, not a dead end.

🧩 THE AGIX EXPLORATION ENGINE (AEE)

Think of this as an invisible AI concierge layer running across the site.

It answers ONE question everywhere:

“What should this user explore next — right now?”

1️⃣ GLOBAL COMPONENTS (USED ON ALL PAGES)

These are shared, not repeated.

A. Exploration State Manager (Session-Based)

Store in sessionStorage:

entry_page_type → home / service / industry / case-study

selected_user_type → new / startup / smb / enterprise

tools_completed[]

pages_visited[]

confidence_level (low / medium / high)

This lets AGIX remember the user during the visit.

B. Persistent “Guide Me” Entry Point

Visible on every page (non-intrusive):

🧭 Not sure what to explore next?

This always opens the same Exploration Modal, but content adapts dynamically.

2️⃣ ENTRY POINT LOGIC (URL DETECTION)
Detect page type from URL:
URL Pattern	Page Type
/	HOME
/services/*	SERVICE
/industries/*	INDUSTRY
/case-studies/*	CASE STUDY
/tools/*	TOOL

This decides:

Which question to ask first

Which tool version to show

Which next links are relevant

3️⃣ ONE EXPLORATION FLOW (ADAPTIVE, NOT DUPLICATED)

Instead of 4 separate tools, you create ONE adaptive flow with conditional logic.

🔄 UNIVERSAL EXPLORATION FLOW (UEF)
STEP 1 — ORIENTATION (Always First)

Question:

“What best describes you right now?”

Options:

Exploring AI for the first time

Building or scaling a product

Running day-to-day operations

Managing large or complex systems

→ Sets selected_user_type

STEP 2 — CONTEXTUAL QUESTION (URL-Aware)

This question changes based on entry page.

If user entered via:

HOME → ask about business challenge

SERVICE page → ask why they’re here

INDUSTRY page → ask industry pain

CASE STUDY → ask similarity level

Example (Service page):

“What made you explore this AI capability?”

Curious

Actively evaluating

Have a problem

Comparing vendors

STEP 3 — READINESS SIGNAL

Lightweight, non-technical:

Tools used today?

Volume / scale?

Risk sensitivity?

This determines:

Lite guidance vs deep strategy

Tool depth

4️⃣ OUTPUT SYSTEM (THIS IS WHERE USERS STAY)

Every exploration ends with a 3-layer output — consistent everywhere.

🟢 OUTPUT LAYER 1 — CLARITY

Where you are right now

AI Stage: Early / Functional / Scaling / Strategic

This reassures users immediately.

🟡 OUTPUT LAYER 2 — WHAT TO PURSUE (NOT EVERYTHING)

What makes sense to pursue next

Only 1–2 recommendations, never more.

Examples:

“Start with Operational Intelligence”

“Conversational AI fits your use case”

“You need readiness before automation”

🔵 OUTPUT LAYER 3 — GUIDED NEXT STEPS (LINKED)

Always show exactly 3 actions:

Explore a Tool
→ /tools/* (contextual)

Understand the System
→ /services/*

See Real Proof
→ /case-studies/* (filtered)

This triangle prevents exits.

5️⃣ PAGE-SPECIFIC BEHAVIOR (IMPORTANT)

Now let’s apply this system page by page.

🏠 HOME PAGE — ROLE

❌ Not to explain
✅ To start the exploration engine

Implementation:

Hero CTA → Opens Exploration Modal

4 cards → Preselect selected_user_type → Launch flow

No deep tools here — only initiation

Output:

Route users to Tools / Services / Case Studies

Never end on Home

🛠 SERVICE PAGES — ROLE

❌ Not to list features
✅ To validate intent + deepen understanding

Add:

Mid-page prompt:

“Is this the right AI system for you?”

Click → Launch Exploration Flow at Step 2, skipping basics.

Output:

Confirm or redirect:

“Yes, this fits you” → deeper service

“No, better option exists” → alternate service

🏭 INDUSTRY PAGES — ROLE

❌ Not to generalize AI
✅ To contextualize relevance

Trigger exploration with:

“How does AI apply to your setup?”

Industry-specific questions injected.

Output:

Industry-fit score

Recommended AI systems

Industry case studies only

📊 CASE STUDY PAGES — ROLE

❌ Not just storytelling
✅ To answer: “Will this work for me?”

Inject:

“How similar is your situation?”

Inputs:

Industry similarity

Scale

Challenge match

Output:

“Very similar / Somewhat / Not similar”

What would change for their case

Next:

Tool

Service

Contact (only if confidence high)

6️⃣ EXPLORATION LOOP (CRITICAL)

After every action:

Update pages_visited

Increase confidence_level

Once confidence = HIGH:

Replace soft CTAs with:

“Ready to discuss your setup?”

This prevents premature sales prompts.

7️⃣ WHY USERS DON’T LEAVE

Because:

There is always a next step

That next step feels relevant

They are not asked to “decide” — they’re guided

The site feels aware, not static

8️⃣ IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST (EXECUTION)
Phase 1 (Fast)

Session-based state

Exploration modal

URL detection

Basic routing

Phase 2

Contextual questions

Case-study filtering

Progress indicator

Phase 3

Confidence scoring

Smart CTAs

Analytics feedback loop

9️⃣ KEY RULES (DO NOT BREAK)

Never show more than 2 recommendations

Never repeat the same question twice

Never force contact early

Always offer:

Tool

System

Proof

🔑 FINAL TRUTH

AGIX will stop being:

“An AI services website”

And become:

An AI decision environment

That’s what keeps users inside.
