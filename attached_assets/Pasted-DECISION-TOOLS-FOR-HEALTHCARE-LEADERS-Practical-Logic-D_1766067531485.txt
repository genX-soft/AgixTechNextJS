DECISION TOOLS FOR HEALTHCARE LEADERS
Practical, Logic-Driven Tools to Choose the Right AI — Safely

Healthcare organizations cannot afford to “experiment blindly” with AI.
These tools are designed to remove guesswork and help leaders choose what to build, when to build it, and why — based on real operational data.

No sales pressure.
No black-box recommendations.
Only transparent logic.

🔧 TOOL 1 — HEALTHCARE AI SOLUTION FINDER
(Primary Decision Engine)

Purpose
Identify the single safest and highest-impact AI system a healthcare organization should start with — based on measurable bottlenecks.

INPUTS (Structured)
1️⃣ Organization Type

Clinic

Multi-specialty Clinic

Hospital

Diagnostic Center

Digital Health / Telemedicine

2️⃣ Monthly Patient Volume

< 1,000

1,000 – 5,000

5,000 – 20,000

20,000

3️⃣ Primary Operational Challenge (select up to 2)

Long patient wait times

Clinician overload / burnout

Missed follow-ups

Diagnostic delays

High claim rejections

Compliance / audit pressure

4️⃣ Care Delivery Model

In-person

Telehealth

Hybrid

5️⃣ Existing Systems

HIS / EMR present (Yes / No)

Billing / Claims system present (Yes / No)

DECISION LOGIC (TRANSPARENT & DETERMINISTIC)
IF wait_times = high
AND patient_volume >= 1000
→ Recommend Patient Intake & Triage AI

IF clinician_overload = high
→ Recommend Clinical Workflow & Documentation AI

IF followups_missed = high
AND care_model IN (Telehealth, Hybrid)
→ Recommend Patient Engagement & Follow-Up AI

IF diagnostic_delays = high
AND organization_type = Diagnostic Center
→ Recommend Diagnostic Workflow Intelligence

IF claim_rejections = high
AND billing_system = Yes
→ Recommend Claims & Revenue Cycle AI

IF compliance_pressure = high
→ Add Governance & Audit Layer (mandatory)

🧠 Why This Fits Your Organization

(clear explanation mapped to inputs)

⏱ Expected Timeline

(weeks, not vague months)

💰 Cost Range

(realistic healthcare-grade estimate)

🔁 Phase-2 Roadmap

(next safest expansion)

EXAMPLE OUTPUT

Recommended Starting AI:
Patient Intake & Triage Intelligence

Why:
High patient volume and long waiting times indicate intake inefficiency.
This system reduces front-desk load without clinical risk.

Timeline:
5–7 weeks

Estimated Cost:
$14K – $18K

Next Phase:
Clinical Documentation Support

🔧 TOOL 2 — OPERATIONAL LEAKAGE CALCULATOR
(Cost Justification Engine)

Purpose
Quantify hidden financial and operational losses caused by inefficiencies — before AI investment.

INPUTS
1️⃣ Average Daily Patient Count
2️⃣ Average Waiting Time (minutes)
3️⃣ % Missed Appointments / No-Shows
4️⃣ Avg Documentation Time per Patient (minutes)
5️⃣ Claim Rejection Rate (%)
CALCULATION LOGIC (SAMPLE)
Waiting Cost =
(wait_time / 60) × avg_staff_cost × patients_per_day × working_days

No-Show Cost =
missed_appointments × avg_revenue_per_visit

Documentation Cost =
(extra_minutes / 60) × clinician_hourly_cost × patients_per_day

Claims Leakage =
rejection_rate × avg_claim_value × monthly_claims

OUTPUT

Estimated annual cost leakage

Top 3 leakage contributors

AI systems that directly reduce each leakage

Priority ranking (High / Medium / Low)

EXAMPLE OUTPUT

Annual Leakage Identified: $380,000

Top Issues:

Intake delays

Documentation overhead

Claim rejections

Recommended Priority:
Start with Intake AI → Documentation AI → Claims Intelligence

🔧 TOOL 3 — AI READINESS & RISK ASSESSMENT
(Safety & Governance Gate)

Purpose
Ensure AI adoption does not increase clinical or compliance risk.

INPUTS (Scored 1–5)
1️⃣ Data Quality

Structured patient records

Consistency across systems

2️⃣ Workflow Maturity

Standardized processes

Clear handoffs

3️⃣ Compliance Sensitivity

Audit frequency

Regulatory exposure

4️⃣ Change Readiness

Staff openness

Leadership alignment

SCORING LOGIC
Readiness Score = (Data + Workflow + Change) / 3

IF Readiness < 2.5
→ Start with Assistive AI only

IF Compliance Sensitivity >= 4
→ Governance Layer required

IF Workflow Maturity < 3
→ Avoid automation-heavy AI

OUTPUT

Readiness Score (0–5)

Risk Flags (if any)

Allowed AI Categories

Recommended deployment style

EXAMPLE OUTPUT

Readiness Score: 3.2 / 5

Risk Flag: High Compliance Sensitivity

Recommendation:

Start with Intake + Follow-Up AI

Add Governance Layer immediately
