________________________________________
🔷 PART 4 — REAL COST, REAL ROI & INTERACTIVE DECISION TOOLS
Make Supply Chain AI Decisions with Operational Evidence
________________________________________
Why This Section Exists
In logistics and supply chain, AI initiatives fail when:
•	Costs are unclear
•	ROI is generic
•	Integration risk is underestimated
•	Teams are forced into “rip-and-replace” decisions
This section lets you self-evaluate:
•	Where money leaks today
•	What AI fixes first
•	What it costs and how fast it pays back
•	Whether your data and systems are ready
— before involving IT change boards or operations committees.
________________________________________
💰 SECTION 4.1 — HOW SUPPLY CHAIN AI COST IS ACTUALLY DETERMINED
Supply chain AI cost is driven by volume, variability, and decision complexity, not model count.
Primary Cost Drivers
1️⃣ SKU count and demand volatility
2️⃣ Number of warehouses, routes, or lanes
3️⃣ Order / shipment volume
4️⃣ Integration points (ERP, WMS, TMS)
5️⃣ Frequency of re-planning required
6️⃣ Exception handling & human approval needs
________________________________________
Practical Cost Reference (Used in Tools)
Business Type	Typical Starting Scope	Cost Range
SMB / Regional Operator	Forecasting or Routing AI	$6K – $15K
Mid-Market Supply Chain	Inventory + Routing	$15K – $35K
Large Manufacturer / 3PL	Visibility + Optimization	$35K – $60K
Enterprise / Multi-Network	End-to-End Planning AI	$60K+
These are production-grade, ERP-integrated systems, not dashboards or pilots.
________________________________________
📦 SECTION 4.2 — DELAY, INVENTORY & COST LEAKAGE CALCULATOR
🔧 Tool 1: Supply Chain Leakage Impact Calculator
What This Tool Answers
“How much revenue, margin, and working capital are we losing due to forecasting errors, excess inventory, and transport inefficiencies?”
________________________________________
🔹 Inputs (User Enters)
1.	Monthly order or shipment volume
2.	Average order value
3.	Stockout rate (%)
4.	Overstock holding cost (%)
5.	Transport cost per shipment
6.	Average delay rate (%)
________________________________________
🔹 Industry Benchmarks (Shown Transparently)
•	Stockouts cause 4–10% revenue loss
•	Excess inventory locks 20–30% extra working capital
•	Route inefficiency inflates transport cost by 10–25%
________________________________________
🔹 Calculation Logic (Readable)
Stockout Loss =
Orders × Avg Order Value × Stockout %

Overstock Cost =
Inventory Value × Holding Cost %

Transport Leakage =
Shipments × Transport Cost × Inefficiency %

Total Monthly Leakage =
Stockout Loss + Overstock Cost + Transport Leakage
________________________________________
🔹 Example Output (Realistic)
Orders: 40,000 / month
Avg Order Value: $120
Stockout Rate: 6%
Transport Cost: $14 / shipment
Result
•	Stockout loss: $288,000
•	Overstock cost: $210,000
•	Transport leakage: $168,000
Total Monthly Leakage: $666,000

❓ 15 HIGH-INTENT LOGISTICS & SUPPLY CHAIN AI FAQs
________________________________________
1. Will AI replace our ERP, WMS, or TMS?
No.
AGIX builds AI layers that sit on top of existing systems. Your ERP/WMS/TMS remains the system of record.
________________________________________
2. Can we start with one warehouse, route, or SKU group?
Yes.
Most deployments begin with a pilot scope (single warehouse, region, or lane) and expand after validation.
________________________________________
3. How does AI handle seasonality and demand spikes?
By using:
•	Time-series models
•	External signals (holidays, promotions, trends)
•	Continuous re-forecasting
This avoids static, one-time forecasts.
________________________________________
4. Will planners lose control over decisions?
No.
AI provides recommendations with rationale. Human approval and overrides remain in place.

5. What happens if AI makes a wrong recommendation?
Safeguards include:
•	Confidence bands
•	Human-in-the-loop approvals
•	Rollback-ready deployments
•	Continuous learning from outcomes

6. How long before we see measurable ROI?
Typically:
•	30–60 days for routing & visibility
•	60–90 days for inventory optimization
•	One planning cycle for forecasting accuracy

10. Will this slow down operations during rollout?
No.
Deployments are staged outside peak cycles, with shadow-mode testing before any live recommendations.
________________________________________
11. Can AI adapt as our network grows or changes?
Yes.
Models retrain as:
•	SKUs change
•	Routes expand
•	Volumes grow
Scalability is built in.
