🔴 1️⃣ CORE FOUNDATION (Non-Negotiable)

You already mentioned Leads — that’s correct, but it needs depth.

1. Lead Intelligence (Beyond “Name + Email”)

Each lead should automatically store:

Identity

Name

Email

Company

Role (CXO, Founder, Manager, Dev, Ops)

Country / Timezone

Intent Signals

Source page (Home / Intelligence / Service / Industry / Case Study)

Exact CTA clicked

Scroll depth %

Time spent before submitting

Exit intent or mid-page CTA

Business Context

Industry selected

Company size

Current challenge (multi-select)

Urgency (Now / 30 days / Exploring)

AI Readiness Tag (Auto-computed)

Early Explorer

Budget-Aware Evaluator

Ready for Pilot

Enterprise / Multi-System

✅ This allows lead prioritization without human guessing.

🟠 2️⃣ CTA & Funnel Intelligence (Very Important)

Since AGIX uses contextual CTAs, admin must show:

2. CTA Performance Dashboard

CTA name

Page type (Home / Intelligence / Service / Industry)

Views → Clicks → Submissions

Conversion %

Drop-off stage

3. CTA Fatigue Control

How many times CTA shown per user

Whether user ignored or engaged

Auto-suppress low-performing CTAs

💡 This prevents AGIX from looking “pushy” and keeps UX premium.

🟡 3️⃣ Intelligence Layer Mapping (AGIX-Specific)

This is where AGIX becomes non-generic.

4. Intelligence Demand Heatmap

Track interest across:

Operational Intelligence

Conversational Intelligence

Decision Intelligence

Autonomous Agentic Systems

Enterprise Knowledge Intelligence

Admin View:

% interest per intelligence layer

Which industries map to which intelligence

High-intent vs curiosity traffic

👉 This directly guides:

Content investment

Sales messaging

Productized offerings

🟢 4️⃣ Industry & Use-Case Intelligence
5. Industry Interest Matrix

For each industry page:

Page visits

CTA conversions

AI systems requested

Common pain points selected

Example:
Healthcare →
• 42% Operational Leakage
• 31% Patient Intake Automation
• 27% Decision Support

This becomes sales ammo + website optimization data.

🔵 5️⃣ Qualification & Scoring Engine (Critical for Focus)
6. Lead Scoring (AI-Assisted)

Score based on:

Company size

Budget hint

Urgency

Intelligence layer selected

Depth of engagement

Auto-label:

🔥 High-Value Enterprise Lead

⚡ Pilot-Ready SMB

🌱 Education / Awareness Lead

AGIX should never treat all leads equally.

🟣 6️⃣ Content & Case Study Intelligence
7. Case Study Performance

Admin should show:

Which case studies drive leads

Industry → Case Study correlation

Time spent on each case study

8. Content Gap Detection

Example:

High traffic on “Decision Intelligence”

Low conversion
→ Signals missing proof / CTA mismatch

This guides what case study or tool to build next.

🟤 7️⃣ Trust & Readiness Signals
9. AI Readiness Diagnostics (Internal)

Aggregate insights like:

% leads lacking clean data

% afraid of compliance risk

% unclear about ROI

This helps AGIX:

Build education tools

Create risk-reduction messaging

Position phased adoption clearly

⚫ 8️⃣ Admin-Only Strategic Tools (Advanced)
10. Sales Enablement Console

For each lead:

Recommended pitch angle

Suggested case studies

Suggested intelligence layer entry point

Suggested pricing band ($10K–$50K)

11. Feedback Loop Dashboard

Objections raised

Deals lost reasons

Stage where users drop

This keeps AGIX strategy reality-aligned.

🧠 9️⃣ System Governance & Control
12. CTA & Messaging Control Panel

Edit CTA copy without redeploy

Enable/disable CTAs per page type

A/B test intelligence messaging

13. Compliance & Data Control

Consent logs

Region-based data handling

Lead deletion / export control

Tier 2 (Strategic)

🚀 Final Thought (Important)

If AGIX admin is only “Leads + Status”,
you’re operating blind.

If AGIX admin shows Intent + Intelligence Demand + Readiness,
you’re operating like an AI systems company.
