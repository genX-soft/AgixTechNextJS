Frequently Asked Questions
Why do 87% of AI projects fail, and is it really about data?
Yes, data issues are the primary cause. The failure modes are:

1. Quality problems (35%) – missing values, inconsistencies, outdated information;
2. Access issues (25%) – siloed systems, lack of integration, security restrictions;
3. Preparation overhead (20%) – 70-80% of project time spent on data wrangling;
4. Governance gaps (20%) – unclear ownership, compliance concerns, and lack of documentation. Solving data issues before starting AI projects dramatically improves success rates.

Should we invest in a data lakehouse, data mesh, or traditional warehouse?
It depends on your organization: Data Lakehouse (Delta Lake, Iceberg) – best for mixed structured/unstructured data with analytics + ML workloads; Data Mesh – best for large organizations with 100+ data consumers and strong domain expertise; Modern Warehouse (Snowflake, BigQuery) – best for primarily structured data with emphasis on BI + analytics. AGIX typically recommends hybrid approaches: warehouse for BI, lakehouse for ML, with unified governance.

How long does it take to become “AI-ready” from a data perspective?
Timeline depends on starting maturity:

Level 1 (Chaotic) to AI-Ready: 18-24 months;
Level 2 (Reactive) to AI-Ready: 12-18 months;
Level 3 (Managed) to AI-Ready: 6-12 months.

AGIX accelerates these timelines by 40-60% through proven transformation playbooks, pre-built integrations, and parallel workstreams. Critical path items are typically: data quality automation (3-4 months), master data management (4-6 months), and feature store deployment (2-3 months).

What is a feature store and do we need one?
A feature store is a centralized repository for ML features (transformed data inputs). You need one if:

1. Multiple ML models use similar data transformations;
2. You need consistent features across training and inference;
3. Data scientists spend significant time recreating features;
4. You want to share and reuse ML features across teams.

ROI is typically 30-50% reduction in ML development time and 70% improvement in model consistency.

How do we handle data governance for AI without slowing down innovation?
Modern data governance enables rather than blocks. Key principles:

1. Automated classification – use ML to classify data sensitivity automatically;
2. Policy-as-code – encode governance rules that run automatically in pipelines;
3. Self-service with guardrails – let teams access data within automated boundaries;
4. Continuous monitoring over upfront approval – detect anomalies rather than requiring approvals.

AGIX governance frameworks typically reduce data access time from weeks to hours while improving compliance.

What is the role of a Chief Data Officer in AI transformation?
The CDO must evolve from a governance-focused role to an enablement-focused role. Key responsibilities include:

1. Data Strategy – aligning data investments with AI/business priorities;
2. Data Products – treating data as a product with consumers, SLAs, and quality guarantees;
3. Talent – building hybrid teams with data engineering, ML engineering, and domain expertise;
4. Vendor Management – evaluating and integrating modern data platforms.

Successful CDOs spend 60%+ of time on enablement vs. compliance.

How do we prioritize which data to fix first?
Prioritize based on AI use case value and data criticality. Start with data that supports high-value AI initiatives and is used across multiple use cases. The AGIX prioritization framework scores data domains on:

1. Business impact (revenue, cost, risk);
2. Current quality level;
3. Effort to remediate;
4. Number of downstream consumers.

This typically identifies 3-5 “foundational” domains that unlock 60-80% of AI use cases.
